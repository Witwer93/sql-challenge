# sql-challenge

Biggest challenge was definitely building the database itself. I struggles with my imports for a long time before finally actually getting the csv
files loaded into the correct tables. After that I found I needed to recreate several tables and redo the imports because I'd declared my columns
with inconsistent value types (ie. varchar vs. int).

Once I got all the data loaded I ran into issues in the first 3 data analysis questions because I didn't have a firm grasp on how to use 'join's, but
when I finally got those issues resolved I was able to finish the remaining data analysis questions very quickly. This homework has an interesting design
just because it is so dependant on the student having a firm grasp on how to get their database setup correctly, but once I was able to get moving
the questions themselves almost feel too easy. This was definitely a situation where the first question (data analysis 1) took me over an hour to finish
but the final question (data analysis 8) took maybe 5 minutes. 

Overall this was really helpful, I learned a lot and feel I have a firm grasp on SQL/pgadmin.
